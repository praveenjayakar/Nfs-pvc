How to install NFS server on linux

sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y

and it will going to install all the packages

check the status of nfs server

systemctl status nfs-server


it will show the status of running state.


and now make a directory from root to expose that directory to use as a nfs storage

mkdir -p /srv/nfs/pj/nfstesting

so in my case i have created a directory like this

so now add the same dir path in /etc/exports 

and this is nfs configuration

sudo vi /etc/exports


/srv/nfs/pj/nfstesting *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,insecure)


and here * represents the nfs mount availble for for open world means everyone can use it. but if you want to restrict to specific cidr range your mention there.


and also the arguments along with red and write i have given insecure. kindly try to ignore it . in my case if i did not use that and the mount is not working.


and now make sure given certails permissions to nfs directory path

chmod 666 -R /srv

once that done if you want to see which directory exposed as nfs storage you can view it by using this command.


sudo exportfs -rav

sudo exportfs -v 

both commands will work same

showmount -e ( it will work in nfs server )

from other servers you can see the mounts by passing the nfs ip

showmount -e ip


if you want to mount this nfs storage to a server use this command

mount -t nfs nfsserverip:/srv/nfs/pj/nfstesting /mnt

it will mount to /mnt

if you want to unmount use this

umount /mnt


mount | grep -i nfs   ( to check nfs unmounted or not)
